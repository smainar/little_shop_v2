# Project: Little Shop of Furniture

The Little Shop of Furniture is a fictitious e-commerce application that has admins, merchants, registered users, and visitors. Our application allows admins to manage all users.
Merchants can fulfill orders, change order status and enable/disable items.  Registered users and visitors can browse the items, place items in their shopping cart and checkout.
Customers of the site can register and log in.
